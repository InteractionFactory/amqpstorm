# Changelog

### Version 1.3.0
- Added Error mapping based on the AMQP 0.9.1 specifications (when applicable).
        - documentation: This provides (where applicable) the official AMQP Specification documentation string.

    These variables are available on all AMQP-Storm exceptions, but if no error code was provided, they will return None.

    Usage:
        except AMQPChannelError as why:
                self.channel.queue.declare(queue_name)

- Fixed Runtime exception caused by listener trying to join itself.


- Removed noisy logging.
