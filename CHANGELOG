# Changelog

### Version 1.3.0
- Added Error mapping based on the AMQP 0.9.1 specifications (when applicable).
    Introduced three new variable to the AMQP-Storm Exceptions.
        - error_code: This provides an HTTP style error codes based on the AMQP Specification.
        - error_type: This provides the full AMQP Error name; e.g. NO-ROUTE.
        - documentation: This provides (where applicable) the official AMQP Specification documentation string.

    These variables are available on all AMQP-Storm exceptions, but if no error code was provided, they will return None.

    Usage:
        except AMQPChannelError as why:
            if why.error_code == 312:
                self.channel.queue.declare(queue_name)

- Fixed Runtime exception caused by listener trying to join itself.

- Channels are no longer closed after a Channel throws a recoverable exception.
