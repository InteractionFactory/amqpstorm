### AMQP-Storm 1.0.6
Thread-safe Python AMQP Client Library based on pamqp.

Introduction
-------------
AMQP-Storm is designed to be a thread-friendly library, and the goal is that it
should be an easy easy to use, but powerful library for handling heavy AMQP work-loads.
- Supports Python 2.6 and 2.7, and Python 3.X support can be implemented on requested.

### Credits
